An Obsidian plugin that automatically moves unchecked items from yesterday's daily note to today's daily note.

## Features

## Installation

### Manual Installation

### Development

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode
4. Reload Obsidian to load the plugin

## Building

- `npm run build` - Builds the plugin for production
- `npm run dev` - Builds the plugin and watches for changes

## How it Works

The plugin looks for unchecked items (lines starting with `- [ ]`, `* [ ]`, or `+ [ ]`) in yesterday's daily note and appends them to today's daily note under a "Rolled over from yesterday" section.

## Supported Daily Note Formats

- `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., 2024-01-15)
- `YYYY-MM-DD-dddd` (e.g., 2024-01-15-Monday)
- `DD-MM-YYYY` (e.g., 15-01-2024)
- `MM-DD-YYYY` (e.g., 01-15-2024)
- `YYYYMMDD` (e.g., 20240115)

The plugin also checks for notes in a "Daily Notes" folder.
